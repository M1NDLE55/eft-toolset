# Data architecture

EFT Toolset integrates with Tarkov.dev through a small query system owned by this
application. Tarkov.dev's current public documentation describes JSON responses to GET
requests at `https://json.tarkov.dev`; the previous direct browser GraphQL transport is
not used.

## Request flow

```text
React feature
  -> QueryDefinition (dedupe, TTL, IndexedDB persistence)
  -> apiFetch(operation, variables)
  -> GET /api/tarkov?op=…&v=<canonical JSON>   (single public reads, CDN-cacheable)
     POST /api/tarkov                          (batch reads)
  -> validated operation allowlist
  -> cached json.tarkov.dev resources
  -> localization, ID joins, and narrow projection
  -> feature-specific response
```

The upstream JSON resources are intentionally broad. At the time of migration, the
regular item payload was about 15.8 MB and the map payload about 9.6 MB. They are fetched
server-side, cached in-process, and never forwarded wholesale to a browser.

## Operations

| Operation | Inputs | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item.catalog` | `gameMode` | Search/catalog item projection |
| `item.group` | `gameMode`, up to 100 names | Item-group prices and task names |
| `item.detail` | `gameMode`, item name | Item, tasks, barters, and crafts |
| `gun.list` | `gameMode` | Weapon-picker rows |
| `gun.build-items` | `gameMode`, up to 100 IDs | Complete build nodes |
| `gun.pick-items` | `gameMode`, up to 100 IDs | Lightweight slot-picker rows |
| `gun.preset` | `gameMode`, preset ID | Base item and contained IDs |
| `map.details` | `gameMode`, normalized map key | One joined map projection |

Operation names live in `src/app/lib/api/operations.ts`. The route rejects unknown
operations, undeclared variables, invalid game modes, oversized batches, request bodies
over 64 KiB, slow bodies, and URLs over 2 KiB. It does not accept an upstream URL,
resource name, field selection, or arbitrary query.

`item.catalog`, `item.detail`, `gun.list`, `gun.preset`, and `map.details` are also served
over GET. The variables must be canonical JSON (sorted keys, no extra query parameters),
so each logical request has exactly one URL. Successful GETs are sent with
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=<n>`, where the
stale window is capped so shared caches never serve data past the six-hour stale ceiling.
Responses built from a failed upstream refresh get a 30-second shared cache, and errors
are `no-store`. Configure the CDN to key on the full query string.

The catalog is sent as `[id, name, shortName, image]` tuples, where an empty image means
the standard `{id}-grid-image.webp` asset.

## Upstream resources

- Items, weapon structures, prices, presets: `/{gameMode}/items` and `_en`.
- Trader names: `/{gameMode}/traders` and `_en`.
- Task relations: `/{gameMode}/tasks` and `_en`.
- Barter and craft relations: `/{gameMode}/barters` and `/crafts`.
- Hideout station names: `/{gameMode}/hideout` and `_en`.
- Raid-planner data: `/{gameMode}/maps` and `_en`.

External requests have a 45-second timeout, a 32 MiB response-size guard, status and
shape validation, and a bounded resource allowlist. Upstream failures are translated to
a stable `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` response without exposing internals.

## Cache ownership

- The server resource cache amortizes large upstream downloads and JSON parsing. Resources
  are fresh for five minutes, revalidated in the background without blocking requests for
  up to 30 minutes, and served stale (flagged with `X-EFT-Data-Stale`) for up to six hours
  when tarkov.dev is down.
- Projections and indexes are memoized on the identity of their source resources, so they
  are rebuilt only when upstream data changes.
- `src/instrumentation.ts` warms the item catalog for both game modes at boot. Set
  `WARM_TARKOV_CACHE=0` to disable.
- The client query layer deduplicates concurrent requests and controls stale/max ages.
- IndexedDB holds validated query projections for fast reloads and offline-tolerant stale
  data. Query schema-version bumps invalidate incompatible projections.
- Gun-builder entries keep their existing per-ID TTL envelopes so opening one slot does
  not refetch an entire build tree.

## Rate limiting

The route keeps an in-process token bucket per client and a global bucket. By default the
client is identified by `CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Real-IP`, or the first `X-Forwarded-For`
entry. These headers are spoofable unless the ingress overwrites them, so set
`CLIENT_IP_HEADER` to the single header your proxy sets authoritatively (for example
`cf-connecting-ip` behind Cloudflare or `x-forwarded-for` on Vercel) and block direct
origin access.

## Adding a query

Add a constant to the operation allowlist, declare its variables in
`OPERATION_VARIABLES` and validate them in the server dispatcher, build a narrow response projector, and call it through `apiFetch`. Add fixture
coverage for joins/localization and a live smoke check against both game modes when the
upstream shape changes. Do not expose generic resource paths or restore arbitrary query
text to the browser.
